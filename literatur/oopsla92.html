</p><h1>The WyCash Portfolio Management System </h1>


<em>Ward Cunningham <br>
March 26, 1992 </em> <p>



U.S. pension funds, corporations, and banks invest billions of dollars in the
"cash" markets.  Cash securities are generally considered those with a
remaining term to maturity of less than one year, but can include those
with maturities as long as five years.  Incredibly diverse in nature, cash
securities are actually negotiated between issuer and buyer, and new
security types are frequently introduced into the market.  WyCASH+ is a
portfolio management system which provides basic accounting, record-keeping
and reporting, as well as analytical computations to assist the manager of
cash portfolios. </p><p>

For the development of WyCASH+, Wyatt Software chose to employ object
technology in order to quickly and effectively address the diversity
present in the market.  Objects help in two ways.  First, many security
types fit nicely into an inheritance hierarchy which is directly supported
by our language (Smalltalk) saving us considerable effort in coding.
Second, changing market demands often require massive revisions which we
have been able to accomodate because of the modularity intrinsic in a
totally object-oriented implementation.  Our customers value our
responsiveness as much as, if not more than, our product's fit to their
current needs. </p><p>

We developed the product by incremental growth from a working prototype.
Each member of our small engineering team maintains at least general
knowledge of all aspects of the roughly four megabytes of source code.  This
includes some libraries provided by the vendor and others written to our
specification by third-party contractors.  Mature sections of the program
have been revised or rewritten many times providing the consolidation that
is key to understanding and continued incremental development</p><p>




We believe this process leads to the most appropriate product in the
shortest possible time.  There are pitfalls, however.  Not everyone is
comfortable with sudden changes in direction, especially programmers.
Here the best antidote is more complete familiarity with the product and its
implementation.  Changes will be accepted when they are recognized as
do-able. </p><p>

Another, more serious pitfall is the failure to consolidate.  Although
immature code may work fine and be completely acceptable to the
customer,  excess quantities will make a program unmasterable, leading to
extreme specialization of programmers and finally an inflexible product.
Shipping first time code is like going into debt.  A little debt speeds
development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite.  Objects
make the cost of this transaction tolerable.  The danger occurs when the
debt is not repaid.  Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as
interest on that debt.  Entire engineering organizations can be brought to a
stand-still under the debt load of an unconsolidated implementation, object-
oriented or otherwise. </p><p>

There is little doubt that Wyatt Software will continue to employ object
technology.  Thoroughly versed in the leading object-oriented languages, our
only decision is how best to employ their advantages.  The traditional
waterfall development cycle has endeavored to avoid programming
catastrophy by working out a program in detail before programming begins.
We watch with some interest as the community attempts to apply these
techniques to objects.  However, using our debt analogy, we recognize this
amounts to preserving the concept of payment up-front and in-full.  The
modularity offered by objects and the practice of consolidation make the
alternative, incremental growth, both feasible and desirable (but not
always comfortable) in the competitive financial software market.
