	abstract = {artificial intelligence ({AI}), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory},

	abstract = {In 1950 Alan Turing (1912-1954) published his famous article, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" in the journal Mind. This article is arguably the most influential and widely read article in the philosophy of artificial intelligence. Indeed, most of the debate in the philosophy of artificial intelligence over the last fifty years concerns issues that were raised and discussed by Turing. Turing's genius was not only in developing the theory of computability but also in understanding the impact, both practical and philosophical, that computing machinery would have. Turing believed that computers, if properly designed and educated, could exhibit intelligent behavior, even behavior that would be indistinguishable from human intelligent behavior. His vision of the possibility of machine intelligence has been highly inspiring and extremely controversial. In this classic article Turing presented his well known imitation game and predicted that about the year 2000 "an average interrogator will not have more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning" in the imitation game. Based on the results of the Loebner 2000 contest and the accomplishments in the field of {AI}, as impressive as they are, Turing's prediction remains unfulfilled.},

	shorttitle = {Face recognition},
	abstract = {As one of the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding, face recognition has recently received significant attention, especially during the past several years. At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing recognition techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category. In addition, relevant topics such as psychophysical studies, system evaluation, and issues of illumination and pose variation are covered.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) have been applied to visual tasks since the late 1980s. However, despite a few scattered applications, they were dormant until the mid-2000s when developments in computing power and the advent of large amounts of labeled data, supplemented by improved algorithms, contributed to their advancement and brought them to the forefront of a neural network renaissance that has seen rapid progression since 2012. In this review, which focuses on the application of {CNNs} to image classification tasks, we cover their development, from their predecessors up to recent state-of-the-art deep learning systems. Along the way, we analyze (1) their early successes, (2) their role in the deep learning renaissance, (3) selected symbolic works that have contributed to their recent popularity, and (4) several improvement attempts by reviewing contributions and challenges of over 300 publications. We also introduce some of their current trends and remaining challenges.},

	abstract = {Over the last 5 years, methods based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks ({DCNNs}) have shown impressive performance improvements for object detection and recognition problems. This has been made possible due to the availability of large annotated datasets, a better understanding of the non-linear mapping between input images and class labels as well as the affordability of {GPUs}. In this paper, we present the design details of a deep learning system for unconstrained face recognition, including modules for face detection, association, alignment and face verification. The quantitative performance evaluation is conducted using the {IARPA} Janus Benchmark A ({IJB}-A), the {JANUS} Challenge Set 2 ({JANUS} {CS}2), and the Labeled Faces in the Wild ({LFW}) dataset. The {IJB}-A dataset includes real-world unconstrained faces of 500 subjects with significant pose and illumination variations which are much harder than the {LFW} and Youtube Face datasets. {JANUS} {CS}2 is the extended version of {IJB}-A which contains not only all the images/frames of {IJB}-A but also includes the original videos. Some open issues regarding {DCNNs} for face verification problems are then discussed.},
