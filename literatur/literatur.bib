  abstract = {The task of manually annotating text is often tedious and error-prone. There is a strong need to digitize landscape history because a scalable, relational database with refined texts simply does not exist, ultimately limiting the pedagogical extent of this rich field. The data for the study conducted is a comprehensive textbook (544 pages) titled, “Landscape Design: A History of Landscape Architecture,” by Elizabeth Rogers. The Landscape Studies Initiative and Data Science Institute at the University of Virginia have partnered together to construct a SQL aided application (Flask) that will assist in deep annotation of scholarly texts. Our goal was to utilize machine learning techniques, specifically named entity recognition models (NER) and topic models (TM), not only to optimize the annotation process, but also to provide a fresh perspective on the text through a new index. In this paper, we will look at the training system, design, and architecture of several different NER models, including Python’s spaCy, Stanford’s Named Entity Recognizer, and IBM Bluemix’s Natural Language Understanding tool, and compare their accuracies. Additionally, this paper aims to explore topic modeling from different tools and techniques, such as the Python libraries Gensim and Mallet in order to compare and contrast the relevance of those models to our dataset. The impact that these techniques have on the humanities fields can be astoundingly influential, but severely limited by the availability, size, and domain of the training dataset. Entity Recognition and Topic Modeling, as a result, are far from solved tasks: we will address some of the fundamental challenges that can prevent these systems from being robust and accurate.},

For some time, state-of-the-art BioNER has been dominated by machine learning methods, particularly conditional random fields (CRFs), with a recent focus on deep learning. However, recent work has suggested that the high performance of CRFs for BioNER may not generalize to corpora other than the one it was trained on. In our analysis, we find that a popular deep learning-based approach to BioNER, known as bidirectional long short-term memory network-conditional random field (BiLSTM-CRF), is correspondingly poor at generalizing. To address this, we evaluate three modifications of BiLSTM-CRF for BioNER to improve generalization: improved regularization via variational dropout, transfer learning and multi-task learning.},

It is the problem of finding the members of various predetermined classes, such as person, organization, location, date/time, quantities, numbers etc. The concept of named entity extraction was first proposed in Sixth Message Understanding Conference in 1996. Since then, a number of techniques have been developed by many researchers for extracting diversity of entities from different languages and genres of text. Still, there is a growing interest among research community to develop more new approaches to extract diverse named entities which are helpful in various natural language applications. Here we present a survey of developments and progresses made in Named Entity Recognition and Classification research.},

The documents are systematically double annotated in various rounds to ensure consistent annotations. The annotated documents are finally harmonized to generate representative consensus annotations. In order to demonstrate an example use case scenario, the corpus was employed to train and validate models for the classification of informative against the non-informative sentences. A Maximum Entropy classifier trained with simple features and evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation resulted in the F1 score of 0.70 indicating a potential useful application of the corpus.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract = {The management of drug–drug interactions (DDIs) is a critical issue resulting from the overwhelming amount of information available on them. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can provide an interesting way to reduce the time spent by healthcare professionals on reviewing biomedical literature. However, NLP techniques rely mostly on the availability of the annotated corpora. While there are several annotated corpora with biological entities and their relationships, there is a lack of corpora annotated with pharmacological substances and DDIs. Moreover, other works in this field have focused in pharmacokinetic (PK) DDIs only, but not in pharmacodynamic (PD) DDIs. To address this problem, we have created a manually annotated corpus consisting of 792 texts selected from the DrugBank database and other 233 Medline abstracts. This fined-grained corpus has been annotated with a total of 18,502 pharmacological substances and 5028 DDIs, including both PK as well as PD interactions. The quality and consistency of the annotation process has been ensured through the creation of annotation guidelines and has been evaluated by the measurement of the inter-annotator agreement between two annotators. The agreement was almost perfect (Kappa up to 0.96 and generally over 0.80), except for the DDIs in the MedLine database (0.55–0.72). The DDI corpus has been used in the SemEval 2013 DDIExtraction challenge as a gold standard for the evaluation of information extraction techniques applied to the recognition of pharmacological substances and the detection of DDIs from biomedical texts. DDIExtraction 2013 has attracted wide attention with a total of 14 teams from 7 different countries. For the task of recognition and classification of pharmacological names, the best system achieved an F1 of 71.5\%, while, for the detection and classification of DDIs, the best result was F1 of 65.1\%. These results show that the corpus has enough quality to be used for training and testing NLP techniques applied to the field of Pharmacovigilance. The DDI corpus and the annotation guidelines are free for use for academic research and are available at http://labda.inf.uc3m.es/ddicorpus.},

Many advocate the sustainability goals promoted by ESG while others prefer to maximizing returns and then spending their earnings on social causes. The core problem facing those who want to promote sustainability goals is to define sustainability investing and measure its returns.

We defined 15 broad categories of biomedical named entities for annotation. A pilot annotation phase in which a small portion of the corpus was double-annotated by four annotators was followed by a main phase in which double annotation was carried out by six annotators, and a reconciliation phase in which all annotations were reconciled by an expert. We conducted the annotation in two modes, manual and assisted, to assess the effect of automatic pre-annotation and calculated inter-annotator agreement. We obtained moderate inter-annotator agreement; assisted annotation yielded slightly better agreement and fewer missed annotations than manual annotation. Due to complex nature of biomedical entities, we paid particular attention to nested entities for which we obtained slightly lower inter-annotator agreement, confirming that annotating nested entities is somewhat more challenging. To our knowledge, the corpus is the first of its kind for consumer health text and is publicly available.},

Recently in BioCreative V, a new challenge was organized for the tasks of disease named entity recognition (DNER) and chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction. Given the nature of both tasks, a test collection is required to contain both disease/chemical annotations and relation annotations in the same set of articles. Despite previous efforts in biomedical corpus construction, none was found to be sufficient for the task. Thus, we developed our own corpus called BC5CDR during the challenge by inviting a team of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) indexers for disease/chemical entity annotation and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) curators for CID relation annotation. To ensure high annotation quality and productivity, detailed annotation guidelines and automatic annotation tools were provided. The resulting BC5CDR corpus consists of 1500 PubMed articles with 4409 annotated chemicals, 5818 diseases and 3116 chemical-disease interactions. Each entity annotation includes both the mention text spans and normalized concept identifiers, using MeSH as the controlled vocabulary. To ensure accuracy, the entities were first captured independently by two annotators followed by a consensus annotation: The average inter-annotator agreement (IAA) scores were 87.49\% and 96.05\% for the disease and chemicals, respectively, in the test set according to the Jaccard similarity coefficient. Our corpus was successfully used for the BioCreative V challenge tasks and should serve as a valuable resource for the text-mining research community.},

  abstract = {Named entity recognition (NER) is the task to identify mentions of rigid designators from text belonging to predefined semantic types such as person, location, organization etc. NER always serves as the foundation for many natural language applications such as question answering, text summarization, and machine translation. Early NER systems got a huge success in achieving good performance with the cost of human engineering in designing domain-specific features and rules. In recent years, deep learning, empowered by continuous real-valued vector representations and semantic composition through nonlinear processing, has been employed in NER systems, yielding stat-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review on existing deep learning techniques for NER. We first introduce NER resources, including tagged NER corpora and off-the-shelf NER tools. Then, we systematically categorize existing works based on a taxonomy along three axes: distributed representations for input, context encoder, and tag decoder. Next, we survey the most representative methods for recent applied techniques of deep learning in new NER problem settings and applications. Finally, we present readers with the challenges faced by NER systems and outline future directions in this area.},

  abstract = {New approaches to biomedical text mining crucially depend on the existence of comprehensive annotated corpora. Such corpora, commonly called gold standards, are important for learning patterns or models during the training phase, for evaluating and comparing the performance of algorithms and also for better understanding the information sought for by means of examples. Gold standards depend on human understanding and manual annotation of natural language text. This process is very time-consuming and expensive because it requires high intellectual effort from domain experts. Accordingly, the lack of gold standards is considered as one of the main bottlenecks for developing novel text mining methods. This situation led the development of tools that support humans in annotating texts. Such tools should be intuitive to use, should support a range of different input formats, should include visualization of annotated texts and should generate an easy-to-parse output format. Today, a range of tools which implement some of these functionalities are available. In this survey, we present a comprehensive survey of tools for supporting annotation of biomedical texts. Altogether, we considered almost 30 tools, 13 of which were selected for an in-depth comparison. The comparison was performed using predefined criteria and was accompanied by hands-on experiences whenever possible. Our survey shows that current tools can support many of the tasks in biomedical text annotation in a satisfying manner, but also that no tool can be considered as a true comprehensive solution.},

While a large number of NER software exist today, it remains difficult for NLP and NER practitioners to clearly and objectively identify what software perform(s) the best. One of the reasons is the difference in results across the literature and the lack of information needed to be able to fully reproduce the experiment. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a comprehensive and replicable study to assess the performance of NER software, thus laying the groundwork for future benchmarking and meaningful comparison studies. As part of our experiments, the latest version of five well-known NER software were selected, along with two distinct corpora. We observe a discrepancy between the result we get and the result found in the literature being around 50\% in certain cases. We also found that StanfordNLP usually performs the best.},

All these tools have pretrained NER models that can be imported, used and can be modified or customized according to requirements. This paper explains different NLP libraries including Python’s SpaCy, Apache OpenNLP, and TensorFlow. Some of these libraries provide a pre-build NER model that can be customized. The comparison of these libraries is done based on training accuracy, F-score, prediction time, model size, and ease of training. The training and testing data are the same for all the models. When considering the overall performance of all the models, Python’s Spacy gives a higher accuracy and the best result.},

  abstract = {Background: Information Extraction (IE) is a component of text mining that facilitates knowledge discovery by automatically locating instances of interesting biomedical events from huge document collections. As events are usually centred on verbs and nominalised verbs, understanding the syntactic and semantic behaviour of these words is highly important. Corpora annotated with information concerning this behaviour can constitute a valuable resource in the training of IE components and resources. Results: We have defined a new scheme for annotating sentence-bound gene regulation events, centred on both verbs and nominalised verbs. For each event instance, all participants (arguments) in the same sentence are identified and assigned a semantic role from a rich set of 13 roles tailored to biomedical research articles, together with a biological concept type linked to the Gene Regulation Ontology. To our knowledge, our scheme is unique within the biomedical field in terms of the range of event arguments identified. Using the scheme, we have created the Gene Regulation Event Corpus (GREC), consisting of 240 MEDLINE abstracts, in which events relating to gene regulation and expression have been annotated by biologists. A novel method of evaluating various different facets of the annotation task showed that average inter-annotator agreement rates fall within the range of 66\% - 90\%. Conclusion: The GREC is a unique resource within the biomedical field, in that it annotates not only core relationships between entities, but also a range of other important details about these relationships, e.g., location, temporal, manner and environmental conditions. As such, it is specifically designed to support bio-specific tool and resource development. It has already been used to acquire semantic frames for inclusion within the BioLexicon (a lexical, terminological resource to aid biomedical text mining). Initial experiments have also shown that the corpus may viably be used to train IE components, such as semantic role labellers. The corpus and annotation guidelines are freely available for academic purposes.},

  abstract = {Background: Text mining in the biomedical domain is receiving increasing attention. A key component of this process is named entity recognition (NER). Generally speaking, two annotated corpora, GENIA and GENETAG, are most frequently used for training and testing biomedical named entity recognition (Bio-NER) systems. JNLPBA and BioCreAtIvE are two major Bio-NER tasks using these corpora. Both tasks take different approaches to corpus annotation and use different matching criteria to evaluate system performance. This paper details these differences and describes alternative criteria. We then examine the impact of different criteria and annotation schemes on system performance by retesting systems participated in the above two tasks. Results: To analyze the difference between JNLPBA's and BioCreAtIvE's evaluation, we conduct Experiment 1 to evaluate the top four JNLPBA systems using BioCreAtIvE's classification scheme. We then compare them with the top four BioCreAtIvE systems. Among them, three systems participated in both tasks, and each has an F-score lower on JNLPBA than on BioCreAtIvE. In Experiment 2, we apply hypothesis testing and correlation coefficient to find alternatives to BioCreAtIvE's evaluation scheme. It shows that right-match and left-match criteria have no significant difference with BioCreAtIvE. In Experiment 3, we propose a customized relaxed-match criterion that uses right match and merges JNLPBA's five NE classes into two, which achieves an F-score of 81.5\%. In Experiment 4, we evaluate a range of five matching criteria from loose to strict on the top JNLPBA system and examine the percentage of false negatives. Our experiment gives the relative change in precision, recall and F-score as matching criteria are relaxed. Conclusion: In many applications, biomedical NEs could have several acceptable tags, which might just differ in their left or right boundaries. However, most corpora annotate only one of them. In our experiment, we found that right match and left match can be appropriate alternatives to JNLPBA and BioCreAtIvE's matching criteria. In addition, our relaxed-match criterion demonstrates that users can define their own relaxed criteria that correspond more realistically to their application requirements.},

  abstract = {Manually curating chemicals, diseases, and their relations is of significant importance to biomedical research but is plagued by its high cost and the rapid growth of the biomedical literature. In recent years, there has been a growing interest to develop computational approaches for automatic chemicaldisease relation (CDR) extraction with proposals of different techniques. Despite these attempts, the lack of a comprehensive benchmarking dataset has limited the comparison of different techniques in order to assess and advance the current state of the art. To this end, we set up a challenge task through BioCreative V to automatically extract CDRs from the literature. More specifically, we designed two challenge tasks: disease named entity recognition (DNER) and chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction. To assist system development and assessment, we created a large annotated text corpus that consists of human annotations of all chemicals, diseases and their interactions in 1,500 PubMed articles. A total of 34 teams worldwide participated in the CDR task: 16 in the DNER task and 18 in the CID task. When comparing the text-mined results with the manually annotated ground truth, the best systems achieved an F-score of 86.46 for the DNER task – a result that approaches the human interannotator agreement (0.8875) – and an F-score of 57.03 for the CID task, the highest results ever reported for such tasks. In addition to the accuracy, another novel aspect of our evaluation is that we tested each participating system’s ability to return real-time results in a timely manner: the average response time for each team’s DNER and CID systems are 5.6 and 9.3 seconds via their respective web services. Given the level of participant and team results, we find our task to be successful in engaging the text-mining research community, producing a large annotated corpus, and improving the results of automatic disease recognition and chemical-disease relation extraction.},
