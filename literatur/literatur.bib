  abstract = {"Many high-profile applications, like LinkedIn and Netflix, deliver nimble, responsive performance by reacting to user and system events as they occur. In large-scale systems, this requires efficiently monitoring, managing, and reacting to multiple event streams. Tools like Kafka, along with innovative patterns like unified log processing, help create a coherent data processing architecture for event-based applications. "Event streams in action" teaches you techniques for aggregating, storing, and processing event streams using the unified log processing pattern. In this hands-on guide, you'll discover important application designs like the lambda architecture, stream aggregation, and event reprocessing. You'll also explore scaling, resiliency, advanced stream patterns, and much more! By the time you're finished, you'll be designing large-scale data-driven applications that are easier to build, deploy, and maintain."--},

  abstract = {Named entity recognition (NER) is the task to identify mentions of rigid designators from text belonging to predefined semantic types such as person, location, organization etc. NER always serves as the foundation for many natural language applications such as question answering, text summarization, and machine translation. Early NER systems got a huge success in achieving good performance with the cost of human engineering in designing domain-specific features and rules. In recent years, deep learning, empowered by continuous real-valued vector representations and semantic composition through nonlinear processing, has been employed in NER systems, yielding stat-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review on existing deep learning techniques for NER. We first introduce NER resources, including tagged NER corpora and off-the-shelf NER tools. Then, we systematically categorize existing works based on a taxonomy along three axes: distributed representations for input, context encoder, and tag decoder. Next, we survey the most representative methods for recent applied techniques of deep learning in new NER problem settings and applications. Finally, we present readers with the challenges faced by NER systems and outline future directions in this area.},

Processing biomedical and clinical text is a critically important application area of natural language processing, for which there are few robust, practical, publicly available models. This paper describes scispaCy, a new Python library and models for practical biomedical/scientific text processing, which heavily leverages the spaCy library. We detail the performance of two packages of models released in scispaCy and demonstrate their robustness on several tasks and datasets.

This book explores the critical implications of that evolution: What happens when event and data stream standards help you discover new activity sources to enhance existing businesses or drive new markets? What technologies and architectural patterns can position your company for opportunities enabled by flow? James Urquhart, global field CTO at Pivotal Cloud Foundry, guides enterprise architects, software developers, and product managers through: The business imperative for flow Why worldwide flow is likely to happen The factors that will enable flow in next 5-10 years What you can do to take advantage of worldwide flow as it evolves A Wardley map exploration that shows why worldwide flow is predictable.},
